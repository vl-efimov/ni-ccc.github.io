    <h1>Name Surname</h1>
    <p class="tagline">I like making things work</p>
    <p>Went pure software engineering to computer graphics. I like the web what can be done with it. Curiosity about what's this WebGL thing resulted into trying to make a poor man's augmented reality app. In javascript. Without WebXR.</p>

    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p>There is not much space for more. I'd be happy if this thing found its use, but am completely ok with being here just to watch and soak in some inspiration from the rest of the class.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I want to find features in live camera feed.</li>
        <li>And their descriptors.</li>
        <li>And to find a match with those taken earlier. Ideally with precisely measured GPS coordinates.</li>
        <li>And in combination with other sensors in cell phones use it to find more precise position and direction.</li>
        <li>And draw stuff positioned correctly in 3D space into the image.</li>
        <li>That's pretty much it. Practically re-implementing partial augmented reality.</li>
    </ul>
