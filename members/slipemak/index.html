<p>I am a guy who studied computer science in Ko≈°ice, Slovakia.
At that time, I didn't like my university at all, and my field of study was quite difficult.
But now I major in software engineering. Frankly, I really like my university and am very motivated to perform as well as I can.</p>

<p>Ideas</p>

Short tech overview: I would mostly like to do something using C# or TypeScript.<br>
I still wonder what it could be, but I'd like to develop something not complex yet really interesting, as some mobile application.<br>
