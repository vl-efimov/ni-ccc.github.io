<p>I am a guy who studied computer science in Ko≈°ice, Slovakia.
At that time, I didn't like my university at all, and my field of study was quite difficult.
But now I major in software engineering. Frankly, I really like my university and am very motivated to perform as well as I can.</p>

<p>Hobbies and interests</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keeping my body in shape, therefore gym and calistenic(workout)</li>
    <li>Learning languages (especially english)</li>
    <li>Touch typing (as fast as possible)</li>
    <li>Sports: football, voleyball, swimming</li>
    <li>Hiking and climbing</li>
    <li>Reading books (mostly detectives)</li>
    <li>I used to learn the guitar, but I paused for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideas</p>
<p>
Short tech overview: I would mostly like to do something using C# or TypeScript.<br>
I still wonder what it could be, but I'd like to develop something not complex yet really interesting, as some mobile application.<br>
